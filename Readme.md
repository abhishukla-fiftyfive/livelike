### Web Product Catalog

### Achieved 

Created Single Page App containing below functionalities:

1. Fetch Category list and Product List.
2. Fetch Products by Category
3. Created custom hooks for fetching the products and categories.
4. Added test cases using Vitest and React testing library.
5. Used MUI for UI components

### Steps to run

1. Run `npm install` or `npm i` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to launch the app.
3. Open `http://localhost:5173/` on your browser.

### Steps to run tests

1. Run `npm run test`

### Points to Note:

1. This assignment does not focus on complete reusability, as the product is a single-page app. But if we need we can create a `components` folder for all the core components and then use them where ever required.
2. `Sidebar` and `ProductGrid` are directly included in `HomePage` as there was limited scope of this assignment. If there would have been other requirements in scope , `sidebar` would be static through all the pages.
3. We can imporve the code quality if required and component more reusable.
4. There are limited unit test cases in this assignment due to time constraint but we can add test cases for all components in similar manner.
5. Responsiveness is not considered as part of this submission but if required we can add media queries or MUI APIs. 

 ### Assignment use cases
 
 1. Implement UI based on UX design.
